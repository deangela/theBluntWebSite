            <h2>The Verdict</h2>
            <p class=verdict> Today's surfboard nose guards are designed to protect the board, not the surfer. The Blunt changes all that. This is the first surfboard eye guard designed from beginning to end thinking about the safety of the surfer and others around him or her.</p>

            <h2>The Comparison</h2>
            
            <section class="col1-3">
                This is the the future of noseguards. The blunt is not a simple piece of plastic. It has been engineered to perfection in order to add a series of protective features that will help the enjoyment of surfing last.

            Clearly, the traditional nose guards have one eveint flaw, they still end in a spear shaped form.

        <br>I've been surfing since I was 8 years old, last yaera I had a terrible accident, while doing a high air I had a harsh landing and the tip of my surfboard pierced my left cheek, fortunately no permanent damage was done, but if I would have had The Blunt as a surf tip protector I'm sure the accident would just have been a bruise.</p>
